# Declarative_Programming

This repository is dedicated to Declarative Programming, specifically using the Prolog language.

## Description

The purpose of this repository is to explore and understand the principles of Declarative Programming through practical examples and exercises in Prolog. Declarative Programming focuses on the logic of computation without describing its control flow, making it distinct from imperative programming paradigms.

### Key Concepts:
- **Prolog Syntax**: Understanding the syntax and structure of Prolog programs.
- **Logical Reasoning**: Applying logic-based rules and facts to solve problems.
- **Recursion**: Using recursive techniques for problem-solving in Prolog.
- **Backtracking**: Exploring how Prolog's built-in backtracking mechanism is used to find solutions.
- **Lists and Data Structures**: Manipulating lists and other data structures in Prolog.

## Technologies

- **Prolog**: The primary programming language used in this repository, designed for logical and declarative programming.
